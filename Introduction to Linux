##  History of Linux
📅 Date: September 17, 1991
👨‍💻 Creator: Linus Torvalds (University of Helsinki, Finland)
🧩 First Version: Linux Kernel 0.01 (written in C language)
💡 Initially named “Freax”, later became Linux

Today, Linux powers supercomputers, smartphones,laptops, routers, cars, and even refrigerators!

## Why Linux is used?

- Free and open-source.
- Highly secure and stable.
- Used in servers, cloud environments, DevOps, networking, etc.
- Command-line based — faster and powerful for automation.


## Linux Architecture:

+--------------------+
|  Applications      |
+--------------------+
|  Shell (CLI)       |
+--------------------+
|  Kernel            |
+--------------------+
|  Hardware          |
+--------------------+

## Components:

- Kernel – Heart of the OS; manages CPU, memory, devices.
- Shell – Command interpreter between user and OS.
- File System – Stores data in a structured way.
- User space – Applications and commands run here.

## what is the difference between Linux and Windows?

- Linux is a open-source and free; Windows is paid.
- Linux is more secure and used in servers; Windows is more common in desktops.
- Linux uses commandline(cLI) heavily; Windows is GUI-focus.

## What is the linux file system Hierarchy?

Everything in Linux is treated as a file. some main directories are:

- /home      - user files
- /etc       - Configuration files
- /bin       - basic commands
- /var       - logs, variable data.

## What is the difference between Sudo and Root user?

- Root is the superuser with the full access.
- Sudo allows normal users to run commands with root privilages temporarily.

## What are the file permissions in Linux?

Permissions are read(r), write(w) and execute(x) for the three types:
- User(owner)
