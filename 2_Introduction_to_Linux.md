### Introduction to Linux

###  What is Linux?
Linux is a **free and open-source operating system** known for its **security**, **stability**, and **multi-user capabilities**.

###  What is an Operating System (OS)?
An **Operating System (OS)** is software that acts as a **bridge between the user and the hardware**, allowing applications to run efficiently.

####  Examples of Applications:
Browsers, MS Office, Notepad, Games, etc., all need an OS environment to operate.

### Types of Operating Systems
- Single-user  
- Multi-user  
- Distributed  
- Real-time  
- Embedded  

### Popular Linux Distributions
- RedHat  
- Ubuntu  
- Debian  
- CentOS  
- Fedora  
- OpenSUSE  
- Kali Linux  
- Amazon Linux  
- Rocky Linux  

###  History of Linux
**Date:** September 17, 1991  
 **Creator:** Linus Torvalds (University of Helsinki, Finland)  
 **First Version:** Linux Kernel 0.01 (written in C language)  
 Initially named **“Freax”**, later became **Linux**  

> Today, Linux powers **supercomputers, smartphones, laptops, routers, cars, and even refrigerators!**


###  Why Linux is Used?
- Free and open-source  
- Highly secure and stable  
- Used in servers, cloud environments, DevOps, networking, etc.  
- Command-line based — faster and powerful for automation

#### **Components**

- **Kernel** – Heart of the OS; manages CPU, memory, devices.  
- **Shell** – Command interpreter between user and OS.  
- **File System** – Stores data in a structured way.  
- **User Space** – Applications and commands run here.  

### Difference Between Linux and Windows

| Feature          | Linux                           | Windows                        |

| Type             | Open-source & free              | Paid & closed source           |
| Security         | More secure, used in servers    | Common in desktops             |
| Interface        | Command-line (CLI)              | Graphical User Interface (GUI) |


### Linux File System Hierarchy

Everything in Linux is treated as a **file**. Some main directories are:

| Directory   | Description            |

| /home       | User files             |
| /etc        | Configuration files    |
| /bin        | Basic commands         |
| /var        | Logs and variable data |


###  Sudo vs Root User

- **Root** → Superuser with full system access.  
- **Sudo** → Allows normal users to run commands with temporary admin privileges.  


###  File Permissions in Linux

Permissions are **Read (r)**, **Write (w)**, and **Execute (x)** — assigned to:  
- **User (Owner)**  
- **Group**  
- **Others**

Example:  -rwxr-xr--
👉 Owner = rwx | Group = r-x | Others = r--
